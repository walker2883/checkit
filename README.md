# checkit
Checks all published drupal nodes in local environment for WCAG and generates a report 

A wanted a quick and easy way to see which nodes in my Drupal site failed against WCAG criteria.
checkit.sh uses a bunch node modules and drush to mash it all together.

How to use it?
Clone checkit repo to your drupal root folder and then run checkit.sh. Open pass.html to view the issues.
