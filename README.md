# checkit
Checks all published drupal nodes in a local environment for WCAG and generates a report. 
It's designed to be a quick and easy way to see which nodes in a Drupal site fail WCAG criteria.
checkit.sh uses a bunch node modules and drush to mash it all together.

How to use it?
Clone checkit repo to your drupal root folder
cd into the checkit folder via terminal
enter npm install to install packages

I don't know why but for some reason I needed to instal access-sniff again after npm install.

enter npm install access-sniff

Once all the packagaes are loaded run ./checkit.sh
